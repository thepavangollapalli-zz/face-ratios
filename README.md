face-ratios
===========

Made for a summer research project. Its purpose is to take in pictures of models (which aren't provided) and 
after tracking the major features in their faces, it will calculate the ratios of certain distances in the faces
that are theoretically correlated to beauty. Using this program with models from various cultures, it will build up 
models of the nature of attractiveness in different environments around the world.
