face-ratios

<strong>NOTICE</strong>
<hr>
I'm writing this readme after I deleted the 'faces' directory because someone posted a post on Facebook that I thought may have been related to this repo:
https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackathonhackers/permalink/817394898315997/ 
(you may need to be in the group to see the post)

I really don't know what to say, other than I never intended to create a repo to store 'porn'. I was working with a friend on a summer research project and our objective was to look at the distances between various facial points on models' faces in different countries and cultures. Seeing as our work depended on having a large collection of faces to analyze, we decided to put the images we had gotten from Google images into a private repo on Bitbucket and work on it there. As I started applying for hackathons, however, I decided to migrate my repo over to Github and so I mirrored it, pictures and all.

With that said, I do apologize if anyone was offended by seeing the pictures of those models. This was always meant to be a repo for work only, but I went ahead and deleted the pictures just in case anyone thought it was inappropriate. Sorry :(

(If this isn't the repo y'all were talking about, carry on and have a good day!)
